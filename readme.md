## Dissertation Library

This is the Library for my Dissertation : urn:nbn:de:hbz:38-75331

Its created using Maven and Java. Working with OpenJDK. The Project was managed with the open Source version of IntelliJ but eclipse should also work.

There are executables the Package:

_de.rkrempel.diss.commandlineexecs_

These are command line tools and contain a help.

Comments are usually in english some times they are in german and a few lines later the english version follows, sometimes its missing :-( .

There are several Projects using this code checkout the rest of my Profile.
