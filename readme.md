# Dissertation Library

This is the Library for my Dissertation : urn:nbn:de:hbz:38-75331

Its created using Maven and Java. Working with OpenJDK. The Project was managed with the open Source version of IntelliJ but eclipse should also work.

The Libaray is essential for running the Java-Based [diss-tools](https://github.com/krempelra/disslibrary).

## Executeables

There are executables the Package [_de.rkrempel.diss.commandlineexecs_](src/main/java/de/rkrempel/diss/commandlineexecs/)

[Simple two-mode to one-mode graph projection tool](src/main/java/de/rkrempel/diss/commandlineexecs/InCooccOut.java)

[Verbose two-mode to one-mode graph projection tool](src/main/java/de/rkrempel/diss/commandlineexecs/InCoocOutMultiExport.java)

[Comparison tool for paralell Networks](src/main/java/de/rkrempel/diss/commandlineexecs/ParallelNets.java)

The executeables are command-line tools. They contain a help when executed without parameters.

## Setup

source is in _src_

Include all jar files in _lib_

The rest should be running with the Maven Dependencies

## Comments
